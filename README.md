## Purpose

You can use this action to authenticate to an Open ID Connect in AWS. This uses [Github's OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/249.).

## Requirements

The action requires you to have:
* A configured OIDCProvider in AWS. Instructions [Terraform](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69243572/16982049)/[CloudFormation](https://awsteele.com/blog/2021/09/15/aws-federation-comes-to-github-actions.html).
* An AWS IAM Profile with specific trust policy. Instructions [Terraform](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69243572/16982049)/[CloudFormation](https://awsteele.com/blog/2021/09/15/aws-federation-comes-to-github-actions.html).

## Inputs

The action has two possible inputs:

* `role-arn` (required): AWS ARN of AWS IAM Role to assume (required).
* `session-duration` (optional): Time in seconds that the session keys need to be valid (AWS_ACCESS_* only). Default 1000s. 

## Outputs

* `token`: the bearer token you can use to communicate with your cluster. Note that this is only valid for a few minutes.
* `raw`: the raw output of `aws eks get-token`. This is a JSON structure that includes extra metadata.
* `aws_web_identity_token_file`: the web identity token file which can be used by the [AWS cli/SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-oidc).
* `aws_access_key_id`: AWS access key id associated with an IAM role.
* `aws_secret_access_key`: AWS access key associated with an IAM role.
* `aws_session_token`: Session token value from STS for temporary security credentials 

All outputs are masked in your logging.

## Usage

In this example we log in with AWS, get a token, and then pass the token to an input in a next step:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS authentication
  id: configure-aws
  uses: elseu/sdu-federated-aws-login-action@1.0.0
  with:
    role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/gha-role

- run: aws sts get-caller-identity --region eu-west-1

```
